#### 2024-06-23 15:34 • Coming back and actually doing something with this site

Embarrassingly, I almost forgot that I *had* a GitHub site in the first place. Still, I've remembered now. Let's see what I can do with it.

#### 2022-11-23 13:38 • Cosmetic Changes to Site

Less than 20 minutes ago, I made some cosmetic edits to my GitHub site that is more work-focused by changing a value in the <em>.container</em> tag within the styles.scss file. After committing the changes and browsing the site after the cosmetic changes, I liked how things looked on the site. They looked better, and they looked less like all the content had been squeezed onto the page like toothpaste in a tube. No more does the site have bits on the side that are completely devoid of contewnt thanks to the styling of the theme that I put on thie site this time last week. Those empty bits have been significantly reduced in size by 115px on each side. The width of the content has been changed from 740px to 1000px.

#### 2022-11-21 22:28 • Slight Alterations to Blog Layout

I've moved the blog post publishing/updated times to the top along with the categories so they can still be seen straight away, even on longer posts.

#### 2022-11-21 19:27 • Site-Related Blog Posts Consolidated

The blog posts have been consolidated such that there only exists one blog post for logging the updating of the site, namely this one. It should prevent satuation of the blog with updates about the site.

#### 2022-11-19 23:59 • Time Visible on Blog Posts

Minor updates. The time should now be visible *and* accurate on blog posts.

#### 2022-11-16 11:30 • The Site is Live

After a frustrating attempt at getting the site working yesterday, leading me to give up at about 1 in the morning out of pure, but rather quiet, frustration, I approached things from a different way.

It works now. At fucking last<a id="#bottom">.</a>
