Having completed a random generator for an office sweepstakes last week for the World Cup that is currently taking place in Qatar, I thought I'd have a go at making a variation of that random generator that possesses a HTML frontend and can be accessed by anyone. The idea is for someone to put a number of inputs into one text box and the exact same number of imputs into the second box. They will then choose something from a dropdown menu that is intended to provide context to the output before then clicking **Start**. The inputs will be shuffled contuously and the chosen items removed from their respective arrays until said arrays are empty.

As of the evening of November 22nd, I have put together part of the frontend, plus I have put a comment explaining what I imagine the frontend will look like once I have completed both that and the backend. It will take some time, plus I do not know how tell it will end up working. I intend to showcase it on Reddit once I am done so I can get other people's opinions on it... that is, if they even notice it anyway.

I'll put in a Google Analytics thing so I can see how often it is used when it is near completion. Google Analytics themselves said the thing will stop collecting data sometime in 2023. They recommended moving over to a new kind of thing but I do not know if GitHub pages supports it yet. Only time will tell.
