It was less than a fortnight ago when I put together a random generator in Python for an office sweepstakes concerning the World Cup 2022, the idea of which people who had entered into the sweepstakes would have been assigned to random teams. The original plan was for someone to write names and teams on pieces of paper and draw them from a pair of plastic containers, but I nixed that in the space of an hour by automating it on a whim. It was mere hours later that my boss decided that he wanted to make a frontend for it in React.

A thought then entered my mind about a random generator that could accomodate inputs and a dropdown menu and make random outputs based on what was entered. This random generator in question would be for anyone to use. It would have a Python backend and a HTML frontend, plus I didn't need nor intend for it to be fancy. It would be a single page and nothing more, but it would work flawlessly based on the intentions of the woman who coded it.

It is far from complete at the moment, but I have at least made a starting point. You can view it below.
