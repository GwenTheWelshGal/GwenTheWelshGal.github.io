#### Twitter Bots

- [ ] A Twitter bot with a ferocious hatred of printers that could only be matched by a certain someone.
- [ ] A Twitter Bot that tweets about random prog rock tracks (start w/ Django Django)
- [ ] Modify the Wednesday Addams Twitter Bot such that actions are run on GitHub and it's no longer reliant on a Raspberry Pi to be active.
- [ ] Fine-tune the error catching. That bit's a complete bitch to get right and I'm not spamming Twitter in the name of testing.
