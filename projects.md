Personal Projects of mine will be added here. Right now, there are <span class="projectcount">{{ page.projectcount }}</span> projects on this page.

I also have a [to-do]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/to-do-list/) list and an [idea list]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/idea-list/), which I am using to keep track of things and so I can have somewhere to put ideas that come to mind.

## [November 2022 • Random Generator]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/Random-Generator/) {#Nov22-RandomGenerator}

Having completed a random generator for an office sweepstakes sometime in November 2022 shortly before the World Cup commenced in Qatar, I thought I'd have a go at making a variation of that random generator that possesses a HTML frontend and can be accessed by anyone. The idea is for someone to put a number of inputs into one text box and the exact same number of imputs into the second box. They will then choose something from a dropdown menu that is intended to provide context to the output before then clicking **Start**. The inputs will be shuffled contuously and the chosen items removed from their respective arrays until said arrays are empty.

## [October 2022 • Lesbian Wednesday Addams Twitter Bot]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/Lesbian-Wednesday-Addams-Twitter-Bot/) {#Oct22-WednesdayAddamsTwitterBot}

A couple of months ago, I started looking into whether I could create a Twitter bot. I had spent some time on it, eventually stumbling across a few videos on the topic. Given that I had a couple of Raspberry Pi's lying around, I decided to put one of them to use. From there, I found a tutorial bosted on GitHub detailing how to create one, and I followed it. Fortunately, the account that I wanted to choose for it had been created a few months ago by yours truly.

I spent quite some time in October working on it and making what improvements I could with the intention of putting it into active use on Halloween 2022, which is a goal I managed to achieve. It's not perfect, but it works, and I am kinda proud of it. Getting the error catching the way I want it to work such that if a tweet is too long or is a duplicate, it prints a certain string that tells me which tweet it was that caused it.

I am still making improvements on it when I can.
