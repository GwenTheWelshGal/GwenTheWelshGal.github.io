## Who am I?

I am Gwen.
Pronouns are she/her.

## What are my interests?

My interests are varied.

#### Gaming

I like to game a lot, and it ends up being a handful of games that I am playing a lot. These games are <em>Star Trek Online</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto V (& GTA Online)</em>, and <em>World of Warships</em>.

I find myself playing Grand Theft Auto Online most of the time, and I've managed to do quite well on there. Hardest part was getting my character on there to resemble LÃ©a Seydoux because that's who my character is the spitting image of in my head.

#### Anime

I do enjoy watching anime, and I have a couple of favourites. One of them is <em>Kakegurui</em>.

My all time favourite anime has to be <em>Sailor Moon</em>, though.

#### Films

I do like watching films, although it depends on what film it is.

I like the <em>John Wick</em> films, the <em>MCU</em> films, and the 2019 film <em>Charlie's Angels</em> to name a few.

#### Computers

I sometimes like to work on [personal projects of mine]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects), which includes [a Twitter bot]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/Lesbian-Wednesday-Addams-Twitter-Bot) that runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B. I plan on altering it such that it runs from actions from its GitHub repo instead, but I have not yet put that into action yet. The running of that bot is entirely dependant on my Raspberry Pi being switched on.

#### Sport

I enjoy watching the Six Nations, especially if Wales is winning.

#### Music

I don't play any musical instruments, but I do enjoy listening to music. My musical interests are all over the place. My favourite bands/artists are Babymetal, Billie Eilish, Gorillaz, and Sabaton.

With the exception of Gorillaz, I have their albums on LPs. With the exception of Sabaton, I have their albums on CDs.

## Am I learning any languages?

I am learning Welsh and French on Duolingo. This is partially because being monolingual sounds a bit boring, partially because there was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=el+ministerio+del+tiempo" target="_blank">some really good show on Netflix</a> that disappeared a while back and the only way for me to watch it is to learn the language it's in to an advanced level (amazed why I'm not doing said language on Duolingo for some reason), and partially because the memes ascribe John Wick-like abilities to that green owl and I very much like to sleep with both my eyes closed.

Linguistics is not my strong suit, so the progress is a bit slow.

## Am I learning any <em>programming</em> languages?

I'm learning Python because I can. The Twitter bot I mentioned was coded in Python and most of my projects may end up being in that language.

### Anything else I should know?

- My [GitHub stats]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/github-stats/), if you want.
